## ‚ú® Key Features

This application is packed with features to solve real-world problems in academic administration:

* **Role-Based Access Control:** Separate, tailored interfaces and functionalities for **Admin** and **Faculty** roles.
* **Real-time Faculty Availability:** Faculty can set their status (Available, Unavailable, Engaged) with a single tap, which is reflected instantly for admins. Includes search, filtering, and PDF report generation.
* **Smart Duty Assignment:** Admins can assign invigilation duties only to available faculty. The assignment automatically updates the faculty's status to "Engaged" and sends a real-time push notification with duty details.
* **Dynamic Seating Arrangement:** A powerful tool to generate complex, multi-branch seating plans. The system prevents students of the same branch from being seated adjacently and generates a shareable PDF.
* **Dynamic Timetable Management:** An intuitive interface to create full examination timetables for different semesters and branches, complete with a PDF export feature.
* **Complete User Management:**
    * Secure sign-up, login, and password reset functionality.
    * Admins can view all users and manage roles (promote to admin/demote to faculty).
    * Users can manage their own profiles, including uploading and removing profile pictures.
* **Real-time Notifications:** A dedicated notification screen with a badge system to alert users of important events (new duties, status changes) and differentiate between read and unread notifications.
* **Modern UI with Theming:** A beautiful, user-friendly interface with full support for both **Light and Dark modes**.
